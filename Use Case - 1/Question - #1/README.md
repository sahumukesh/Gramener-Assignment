- Considering maths as a subject. We need to ignore the missing data.
The factors that influence the marks of student in maths would be :
gender, age, category, sibling, handicap, father edu, mother edu,
father occu, mother occu, BPL, use calculator, use internet, use dictionary,
read other books, number of books read, distance,  computer use, library use,
like the school or not, give math HW, help in studies,
private tuition, Private tuition, Maths is difficult, Solve Maths, Solve Maths in groups,
Draw geometry, Explain answers, Watch TV, Play games, Help in household

- After analysing the data by comparing with various attributes we come to the conclusion 
that the Father's Occupation influences the students performance the most in the maths subject ( with the differnece between the average maximum and the minimum marks to be 8.71215327209). The profession of a Professor/ Lecturer of the father having the highest average maths marks (38.7392) and the occupation as unemployed having the lowest average maths marks (30.0270).

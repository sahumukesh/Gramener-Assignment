# Use case 1 - National Achievement Survey
National Council of Education Research and Training conducts yearly National Achievement Survey. We have provided the data of Class VIII students from 2014. 


# Question - #3

    3. Do students from South Indian states really excel at Math and Science?
    
- Considering the south Indian states like 
Andaman and Nicobar
Andhra Pradesh
Karnataka
Kerala
Pondicherry and 
Tamil Nadu
we need to find the average of the south Indian states (not considering the missing values) 
and compare it with the performance
from all over India considering only maths and science marks of the students!

- After analysing the data by comparing with various attributes we come to the conclusion 
that the south indian states perform poorer as compared to the national average!

- Here is the output of the program:

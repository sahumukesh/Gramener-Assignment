# Question - #2

    2. How do boys and girls perform across states?
    
- Considering maths as a subject. We need to ignore the missing data.
Considering the maths marks from differnet states w.r.t gender we
find the average of the marks w.r.t. each state!

- After analysing the data the number of states where boys outperform is 15 and the states where girls outperform is 18 and the maximum difference between the performance of girls and boys is -  3.22341457934  which is in the state  JH (Jharkhand).
